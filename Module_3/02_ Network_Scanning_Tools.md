# Hping3
hping3 is a network tool able to send custom ICMP/UDP/TCP packets and to display target replies like ping does with ICMP replies. It handles fragmentation and arbitrary packet body and size, and can be used to transfer files under supported protocols. It performs manual path MTU discovery and enables attackers to perform remote OS fingerprinting.
