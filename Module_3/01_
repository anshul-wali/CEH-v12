# Section 3: Scanning_Techniques_for_Host_Discovery
# ARP Ping Scan
ARP packets are sent for discovering all active devices in the IPv4 range even though the presence of such devices is hidden by restrictive firewall. The host IP with the respective hardware destination address is active, then the ARP response will be generated by the host; otherwise, after a certain number of ping attempts, the original OS gives up on the host. 


# UDP Ping Scan
UDP ping scan si similar to TCP ping scan; however, in the UDP ping scan, Nmap sends UDP packets to the target host. The default port number used by Nmap for the UDP ping scan is 40,125.
- UDP response - Host is active
- Error messages (host/network unreachable or TL exceeded) - Host is inactive

# ICMP ECHO Ping Scan
This scan is useful for locating active devices or determining fi ICMP is passing through a firewall.
```
nmap -sn -PE <Target IP Address>
```
# ICMP ECHO Ping Sweep
A ping sweep (also known as an ICMP sweep) is a basic network scanning technique that is adopted to determine the range of IP addresses that map to live hosts (computers)

# ICMP Timestamp Ping Scan
ICMP timestamp ping is an optional and additional type of ICMP ping whereby the attackers query a timestamp message to acquire the information related to the current time from the target host machine. The target machine responds with a timestamp reply to each timestamp query that is received. This ICMP timestamp pinging is generally used for time synchronization. 

# ICMP Address Mask Ping Scan
ICMP address mask ping is another alternative to the traditional ICMP ECHO ping, where the attackers send an ICMP address mask query to the target host to acquire information related to the subnet mask. This type of ping method is also effective in identifying the active hosts similarly to the ICMP timestamp ping, specifically when the administrator blocks the traditional ICMP Echo ping

# TCP SYN ping scan 
This is a host discovery technique for probing different ports to determine if the port is online and to check fi it encounters any firewall rule sets. In this type of host discovery technique, an attacker uses the Nmap tool to initiate the three-way handshake by sending the empty TCP SYN flag to the target host. After receiving SYN, the target host acknowledges the receipt with an ACK flag. After reception of the ACK flag, the attacker confirms that the target host is active and terminates the connection by sending an RST flag to the target host machine

# TCP ACK Ping Scan
TCP ACK ping is similar to TCP SYN ping, albeit with minor variations. TCP ACK ping also uses the default port 80. In the TCP ACK ping technique, the attackers send an empty TCP ACK packet to the target host directly. Since there is no prior connection between the attacker and the target host, after receiving the ACK packet, the target host responds with an RST flag to terminate the request. The reception of this RST packet at the attacker's end indicates that the host si active.

# IP Protocol Ping Scan
IP protocol ping is the latest host discovery option that sends PI ping packets with the IP header of any specified protocol number. It has the same format as the TCP and UDP ping. This technique tries to send different packets using different PI protocols, hoping to get a response indicating that a host is online. Multiple IP packets for ICMP (protocol 1), IGMP (protocol 2), and IP-in-IP (protocol 4) are sent by default when no protocols are specified. 

# Ping Sweep Tools
## Angry PI Scanner
Angry IP scanner is an IP address and port scanner. It can scan IP addresses in any range as well as any of their ports. It pings each IP address to check if any of these addresses are live. Then,  it optionally resolves hostnames, determines the MAC address, scans ports, etc.
