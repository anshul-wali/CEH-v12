- Privilege Escalation by Exploiting Misconfigured Services
	- Unquoted Service Paths
	- Service Object Permissions
	- Unattended Installs
		- Unattended install details such as configuration settings used during the installation process are stored in Unattend.xml file
- Pivoting and Relaying to Hack External Machines
- Privilege Escalation Using Misconfigured Network File System (NFS)
	- A misconfigured NFS paves the way for attackers to gain root-level access through a regular user account or low-privileged user
	- By exploiting NFS vulnerabilities, attackers can sniff sensitive data and files passing through the intranet and launch further attacks
- Privilege Escalation Using Windows Sticky Keys
	- In Windows, the sticky keys feature allows users to use a combination of keys including Ctrl, Alt, and Shift instead of pressing three keys at a time
	- After gaining access to a remote system, attackers must copy the file sethc.exe at the location &systemroot% \system32 to a different location. Next, they must copy cmd.exe to the same location and pressing the Shift key five times in rapid succession once the system has been restarted to open a Command Prompt window  with system-level acces
- Privilege Escalation by Bypassing User Account Control (UAC)
	- When attackers fail to escalate privileges using a simple payload, they attempt to evade Windows security features such as UAC and to gain system-level access
	- In a Windows environment, even if the UAC protection level si set to any option, attackers can abuse a few Windows applications to escalate privileges without triggering a UAC notification
