# Elements of Information security
IS is “the state of the well-being of information and infrastructure in which 
the possibility of theft, tampering, or disruption of information and services is kept low or 
tolerable.”

## Confidentiality 
Assurance that the information is accessible only to those authorized to have access 
## Integrity
The trustworthiness of data or resources in terms of preventing improper or unauthorized changes 
## Availability
Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by the authorized users.
## Authenticity 
Refers to the characteristic of a communication, document, or any data that ensures the quality of 
being genuine 
## Non-Repudiation 
A guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the 
recipient cannot deny having received the message.

# Classification of Attacks 
## Passive Attacks 
- Passive attacks do not tamper with the data and involve intercepting and monitoring network traffic and  data flow on the target network 
- Examples are sniffing and eavesdropping 
## Active Attacks
- Active attacks tamper with the data in transit or disrupt the communication or services between the systems to bypass or break into secured systems 
- Examples are DoS, Man-in-the-Middle, session hijacking, and SQL injection 
## Close-in Attacks
- Close-in attacks are performed when the attacker is in close physical proximity with the target system or network in order to gather, modify, or disrupt access to information 
- Examples include social engineering such as eavesdropping, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving 
## Insider Attacks
- Insider attacks involve using privileged access to violate rules or intentionally cause a threat to the organization’s information or information systems 
- Examples are theft of physical devices and planting keyloggers, backdoors, and malware 
## Distribution attacks
- Distribution attacks occur when attackers tamper with hardware or software prior to installation. 
- Attackers tamper with the hardware or software at its source or in transit.
-  Examples of distribution attacks include backdoors created by software or hardware vendors at the time of manufacture. 
# Information Warfare
Information warfare (IW) (as different from cyber warfare that attacks computers, software, and command control systems) is a concept involving the battlespace use and management of 
information and communication technology (ICT) in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent.
