# Section 3: Footprinting through Web Services

# Finding Company Domains

## Top Level Domain:
A company's top-level domains (TLDs) and sub-domains can provide a large amount of 
useful information to an attacker. It may contain information such as organizational history,
services and products, and contact information. The target organization's external URL can be 
located with the help of search engines such as Google and Bing.

## Tor Browser
Tor, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. It directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide,
volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than seven thousand relays, to conceal a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or
traffic analysis.
