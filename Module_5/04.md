# Section 4: Vulnerability Assessment Reports
The vulnerability assessment report discloses the risks detected after scanning a network. 
- The report alerts the organization to possible attacks and suggests countermeasures.
- Information available in the reports is used to fix security flaws

## Components of a vulnerability assessment report
Vulnerability assessment reports are classified into two types:
- Security vulnerability reports
   This is a combined report of all the scanned devices and servers in the organization's network.
- Security vulnerability summary
   This report is produced for every device or server after scanning.

Avulnerability assessment report covers the following elements:
- Executive Summary
	- Assessment scope and objectives
		- Purpose of the vulnerability scanning
		- Scope of the scanning
	- Testing narrative 
		- Operating systems upon which scanning is performed
		- IP addresses upon which scanning is performed
		- Types of scans performed
		- Date and time (Including start, end, and duration of scan)
	- Findings summary
		- Critical vulnerabilities identified (highlights based on risk level)
			- Number of vulnerabilities based on severity (graphical representation)
		- Identified operating systems
		- Performance of the systems and applications during the scan
		- Overall risk level
		- Critical issues that need to be addressed
		- Remediation summary

- Assessment Overview
	- Assessment methodology
	- Scan information: information such as the type of scan performed, tools used, versions, and the assets scanned.
	- Target information: Information about the target system's name and address.

- Findings
	- Scanned hosts, including each host's detailed information
		- Node: Name and address of the host.
		-  OS: Operating system type
		- Date: Date of the test
		- Vulnerable services: Network services by their names and ports.
	- Types of vulnerabilities identified
	- Detailed information on identified vulnerabilities (including CVE ID, CVS score, threat description, impact caused, remediation, and exploitability)
	- Notes describing additional details of scan results

- Risk Assessment
	- Classification of vulnerabilities based on the risk level: critical, high, moderate, or low 
	- Potential vulnerabilities that can compromise the system or application
	- Critical hosts with severe vulnerabilities 
	- 

- Recommendations
	- Prioritization of remediation based on the risk ranking
	- Action plan to implement the recommendations/remediation for each identified vulnerability
	- Root-cause analysis
	- Application of patches/ fixes
	- Lessons learned
	- Awareness training
	- Implementation of periodic vulnerability assessment
	- Implementation of policies, procedures, and controls
