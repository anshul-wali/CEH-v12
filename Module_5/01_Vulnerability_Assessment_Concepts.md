# Section 1: Vulnerability Assessment Concepts
# Vulnerability 
A vulnerability refers to a weakness in the design or implementation of a system that can be exploited to compromise the security of the system.

Common Reasons for the Existence of Vulnerabilities
- Hardware or software misconfiguration
- Insecure or poor design of the network and applicatio
- Inherent technology weaknesses
- Careless approach of end users

# Vulnerability Research
- The process of analyzing protocols, services, and configurations to discover vulnerabilities and design flaws that wil expose an operating system and its applications ot exploit, atack, or misuse
- Vulnerabilities are classified based on severity level (low, medium, or high) and exploit range (local or remote)

## Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) 

The Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) investigates all reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services, and it provides information as part of an ongoing effort to help security professionals manage security risks and keep
organizational systems protected.

# Vulnerability Assessment
- Vulnerability assessment is an in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and controls, to withstand the exploitation
- It recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities ni a computer system, network, and communication channels
- There are two approaches to network vulnerability scanning:
	- Active Scanning
	- Passive Scanning
- Vulnerability Scoring Systems and Databases
	- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) 
	- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
	- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
	- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)
